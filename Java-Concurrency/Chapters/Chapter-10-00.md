# Advanced Topics in Java Concurrency

## Fork/Join Framework

**Overview:** The Fork/Join Framework is a powerful concurrency framework introduced in Java 7 for parallelizing computationally intensive tasks. It is based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm, where a task is split into subtasks that can be executed concurrently.

**Key Concepts:**

1.  **RecursiveTask and RecursiveAction:**
    
    *   `RecursiveTask` is used when the task returns a result, and `RecursiveAction` is used when the task doesn't return a result.
2.  **Fork and Join Operations:**
    
    *   Tasks can be forked to create subtasks, and the `join` operation is used to combine the results of subtasks.

**Example: Calculating Factorials with RecursiveTask**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveTask;
import java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool;

public class FactorialCalculator extends RecursiveTask<Long> {
    private final int n;

    public FactorialCalculator(int n) {
        this.n = n;
    }

    @Override
    protected Long compute() {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return 1L;
        } else {
            FactorialCalculator subtask = new FactorialCalculator(n - 1);
            subtask.fork();
            return n * subtask.join();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ForkJoinPool forkJoinPool = ForkJoinPool.commonPool();
        FactorialCalculator factorialCalculator = new FactorialCalculator(5);
        long result = forkJoinPool.invoke(factorialCalculator);
        System.out.println("Factorial of 5: " + result);
    }
}

```
In this example, the `FactorialCalculator` extends `RecursiveTask` and calculates the factorial of a number using the Fork/Join Framework.

## Parallel Streams in Java

**Overview:** Parallel Streams in Java provide a convenient way to parallelize operations on collections using the Stream API. Parallel streams internally use the Fork/Join Framework to achieve parallelism.

**Key Concepts:**

1.  **Creating Parallel Streams:**
    
    *   Parallel streams are created using the `parallelStream` method on collections.
2.  **Performance Considerations:**
    
    *   Parallel streams are suitable for operations that can be easily parallelized, but not all operations benefit from parallelism.

**Example: Summing Elements in a List with Parallel Stream**

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class ParallelStreamExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);

        // Sequential stream
        int sumSequential = numbers.stream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
        System.out.println("Sum (Sequential): " + sumSequential);

        // Parallel stream
        int sumParallel = numbers.parallelStream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
        System.out.println("Sum (Parallel): " + sumParallel);
    }
}

```
In this example, the sum of elements in a list is calculated using both sequential and parallel streams.

## Atomic Variables and Non-blocking Algorithms

**Overview:** Atomic variables and non-blocking algorithms are techniques used in concurrent programming to ensure atomicity without explicit locks. Java provides the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package for atomic variables.

**Key Concepts:**

1.  **Atomic Variables:**
    
    *   Classes like `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, and `AtomicReference` provide atomic operations without the need for explicit synchronization.
2.  **Non-blocking Algorithms:**
    
    *   Non-blocking algorithms aim to avoid contention and deadlocks associated with locks by using atomic variables and compare-and-set operations.

**Example: Atomic Counter with AtomicInteger**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class AtomicCounter {
    private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public void increment() {
        count.incrementAndGet();
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count.get();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AtomicCounter counter = new AtomicCounter();

        // Multiple threads incrementing the counter
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            new Thread(() -> {
                for (int j = 0; j < 10000; j++) {
                    counter.increment();
                }
            }).start();
        }

        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000); // Allow threads to finish
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Final Count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}

```
In this example, an `AtomicInteger` is used to implement a thread-safe counter without the need for explicit locks.
