# Synchronized Methods and Blocks


## Synchronization Overview
* **Need for Synchronization**: Preventing data corruption and ensuring consistent results in a multi-threaded environment.
* **Critical Sections**: Identifying sections of code where only one thread should execute at a time.
* **Shared Resources**: Understanding the challenges when multiple threads access shared resources concurrently.

## Using synchronized Keyword
* **Definition**: Introduction to the synchronized keyword as a means of achieving thread synchronization.
* **Scope**: Overview of where the synchronized keyword can be applied in Java.

### Synchronized Methods
* **Definition**: Methods declared with the synchronized keyword.
* **Usage**: Ensures that only one thread can execute the synchronized method at a time. The entire method becomes a critical section, preventing interleaved execution.
* **Example**:
  ```java
  class SharedResource {
      private int count = 0;
  
      // Synchronized method
      public synchronized void increment() {
          for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
              count++;
              System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - Count: " + count);
              try {
                  Thread.sleep(200); // Simulating some work
              } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                  e.printStackTrace();
              }
          }
      }
  }
  
  public class SynchronizedMethodsExample {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          // Creating an instance of SharedResource
          SharedResource sharedResource = new SharedResource();
  
          // Creating multiple threads that share the same instance
          Thread threadA = new Thread(() -> sharedResource.increment(), "Thread A");
          Thread threadB = new Thread(() -> sharedResource.increment(), "Thread B");
  
          // Starting the threads
          threadA.start();
          threadB.start();
      }
  }

  ```
### Synchronized Blocks
* **Definition**: Blocks of code surrounded by the synchronized keyword.
* **Usage**: Allows synchronization of specific sections rather than entire methods. Allows more fine-grained control over synchronization.
* **Example**:
  ```java
  class SharedResource {
      private int count = 0;
      private Object lock = new Object(); // Object used for synchronization
  
      // Synchronized block
      public void increment() {
          synchronized (lock) {
              for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                  count++;
                  System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - Count: " + count);
                  try {
                      Thread.sleep(200); // Simulating some work
                  } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                      e.printStackTrace();
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  }
  
  public class SynchronizedBlocksExample {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          // Creating an instance of SharedResource
          SharedResource sharedResource = new SharedResource();
  
          // Creating multiple threads that share the same instance
          Thread threadA = new Thread(() -> sharedResource.increment(), "Thread A");
          Thread threadB = new Thread(() -> sharedResource.increment(), "Thread B");
  
          // Starting the threads
          threadA.start();
          threadB.start();
      }
  }

  ```

In both examples, two threads (Thread A and Thread B) are concurrently incrementing a shared variable (count) within a synchronized context. This ensures that only one thread can execute the increment operation at a time, preventing race conditions.

## Comparative Analysis
This section provides a comparative analysis of synchronized methods and synchronized blocks in Java, exploring their performance considerations, flexibility, and readability.

### Performance Considerations
* **Synchronized Methods**: Entire method is synchronized, potentially leading to contention and performance overhead.
* **Synchronized Blocks**: Allows more fine-grained control, reducing contention and potentially improving performance.
* **Trade-offs**: Balancing simplicity with performance based on the specific use case.

### Flexibility and Readability
* **Synchronized Methods**: Simplicity and ease of use, especially for small methods.
* **Synchronized Blocks**: Offers more flexibility, allowing synchronization of specific sections within a method.
* **Code Readability**: Synchronized blocks can enhance readability by highlighting critical sections.

### Use Cases and Recommendations
* **Synchronized Methods**: Suitable for small methods where the entire method needs to be atomic.
* **Synchronized Blocks**: Preferable for larger methods where only specific sections require synchronization.
* **Combination**: In some cases, a combination of both synchronized methods and blocks may be optimal.
